  "content": "<h1>The Stillness Beyond Want</h1> <p>The dawn broke over the city’s edge, the sky painted in bruised purples and oily grays. Maya crouched at the edge of the choked lake, watching the water swirl at her feet. She dipped a cracked tin mug into the water and drank deeply, the cool liquid sliding down her throat like a stranger. In the distance, the city was waking: distant horns, the stutter of machinery, neon signs flickering against the morning haze. But here, at the fringe of the urban glow, the world was still as a graveyard.</p> <p>Maya’s mother stood at the mouth of their tin shack, hands folded in prayer. A faded saree hung off her thin frame, and her lips moved silently over words older than time. The morning sky was silent, as if it listened. Maya watched her mother’s lips forming the same request they had murmured all night: “He is always with us. He will provide.” But Maya only saw her mother’s knuckles whiten as she clasped two thin fingers, offering to a God that had never answered.</p> <p>“Ma,” Maya said softly, voice thick with sleep and something else she could not name. She watched her own reflection in the muddy water—sunken eyes, dirt on her face, tiredness older than her years. “Will it be enough today? Will we have something for my brother?”</p> <p>Her mother opened her eyes and smiled a practiced half-smile, as serene and unbreakable as sunlight on water. “The bowl will be filled,” she whispered without certainty, her voice as quiet as a prayer. “Blessed are those who have faith. The rains will come; your brother will not go to bed hungry.”</p> <p>Maya turned away from the reflection of her face, seeing instead the horizon where steel towers clawed at pink light. “The rains will come,” she mocked quietly to herself. “When, Ma? When the city swallows us alive?” Her heart sank at her own words. She bent down to fish a worn blanket from the lake’s edge—her morning task—feeling how heavy the water had made it. She wrenched it out and shook the mud-scented fabric toward the sky, only for a brown flake of mud to fall back onto her cheek. Frustration made her laugh bitterly.</p> <p>Her mother came forward, draping the blanket over Maya’s shoulders even as she bowed her head. The thin fabric could not warm them against the cold truth of hunger and waiting. “Patience, child,” her mother said. “You will see: this world is turning, and it does not leave its children behind.”</p> <p>Maya’s lips curved into a smile that did not reach her eyes. “Is this turning the world I live in, Ma? Or the one you see in your prayers?” She held her breath between words, and for a moment her chest was as still as the lake at dawn. The sky did not answer.</p> <p>For a while they stood in silence. Maya pressed the blanket to her chest and turned away, her heart ticking in stubborn quiet. She began the day’s chores: emptying the water jug into a battered pan, rummaging for the charred rice at the fire’s edge, picking stubborn weeds from the small, dry patch of soil behind their hut. Her little brother tagged behind, trying to help, or at least to keep up. Maya nodded to him once, her eyes fixed ahead. Day by day, nothing changed: the earth remained cracked, and their hunger unrelenting.</p> <p>The day wore on. Maya returned to the dusty alleyways beyond the lake, balancing a small woven basket with scavenged greens and stale rice crusts. Even as the city’s monorail thundered overhead, the world she inhabited remained unmoved by its passage: the same hunger, the same empty pantries. Her fingers traced the rough wood cross of her mother’s prayer beads pocketed at her waist, and she wondered if they had ever prayed hard enough.</p> <p>At the market, Maya spotted a mangy dog gnawing on a bone near a fruit stall. A vendor, a thin, sunburned woman with cheeks like crusty earth, sold rotting oranges. One caught Maya’s eye—pocked, soft skin, juice oozing from a tear in its rind. Relief glimmered inside her chest: a glimmer that was soon drowned.</p> <p>“Why do they waste such fruit while children starve?” Maya hissed to herself. She held out the limp orange toward the dog, then to the woman. The vendor spat. “Garbage,” she snapped, waving Maya off. The dog finished gnawing its bone, then growled as Maya approached. It was not hunger it feared, but pride at being so close to spoilage.</p> <p>Maya turned away. She clutched the orange still warm in her palm. Maybe it was enough. She placed the orange in her basket and kept walking, slow, determined. But with each step, a seed of dread settled in her stomach: this fruit was too good to be true.</p> <p>Back near the lakebank that evening, Maya waited beside the dying embers of a fire for her mother to return. She had planned to share the orange between them, but the throbbing pain in her belly grew sharp and insistent. When her mother finally appeared, dragging tired feet through the dusk light, Maya could not stand. She sank into a squat, doubled over, retching bits of rotten fruit onto the parched soil.</p> <p>Her mother rushed to her, hands gentle on Maya’s back. “Child?” her mother whispered urgently, eyes wide. Maya looked up through blurred vision, water already stinging the corners of her eyes. Her mother held a bowl of water to Maya’s lips, worry etched between the lines of her face.</p> <p>“I—I’m fine,” Maya gasped, afraid her mother would turn angry. The air had gone still; even the cicadas seemed to pause. Her mother’s eyes narrowed. “You fool,” she whispered. “You gave our blessing away.”</p> <p>Maya faintly heard her own voice in the distance, “I did no such thing.” But even as she said it, she felt the truth of her mother’s words more than the lie of them. Somewhere above, the sky was silent.</p> <p>The lake before them darkened with night. Maya knew hunger and sickness both, but which one hurt more?</p> <p>The night deepened. Maya clutched her belly and stared at the stars blankly, wishing for anything to break the silence. A single, ragged sob escaped her lips, but even the wind did not answer. None of it mattered — not the pain, not the hunger, nothing. Above them, a lone star burned on oblivious. Maya curled into herself, feeling more alone than ever, as a silence fell like a shroud across the land.</p> <p>Time passed. Days bled into years, and the weight of the world pressed down on Maya’s shoulders until they bent. Her brother grew from a toddler to a lanky boy, scrubbing dust from old circuit boards in the streets; her own childhood had ended with the orange that night. Now, as a teenager, Maya’s back was permanently bent from chores and labor. She worked at a small street-corner repair stall beneath flickering neon adverts, lungs filling with smoke and metal dust. The modern world buzzed all around her, but Maya felt only the static ache of fatigue.</p> <p>Each morning she walked past the gated compound where a new school had been built. The gates were heavy, barbed wire across the walls—scholars and polished teachers inside, Maya’s world forever outside. Some days, lost children peered through the iron bars, watching classes as they passed. Once, Maya had imagined herself among them, learning letters and equations; now she merely touched the cold metal and moved on. Higher, brighter lives glimmered behind reinforced walls.</p> <p>Her mother, still devout, now prayed for Maya’s safety in this growing chaos. Once, when news came of a distant war she had never understood, her mother lit candles for soldiers lost in battle, and for Maya’s father, who had never returned from that place. Maya had cherished a final letter from him—it was a drawing of galaxies he had sketched for his son. But that letter never arrived; her father vanished in the war, and years later an empty envelope returned, its journey undone by fate. Maya prayed nothing; to her, the void between prayers answered with silence.</p> <p>Even faith, once a comfort to the weak, had become a weapon against her. One afternoon, Maya stood at the temple steps as a procession of wealthy devotees passed beneath a banner of devotion. A polished man’s wife dropped folded bills into the shrine; Maya’s mother joined her hands and bowed. Maya spat dust to the ground. The rich man noticed her grimy feet out of the corner of his eye. Without a word, he pressed his polished shoe down on Maya’s foot, grinding dirt under her toes. The world around them continued as if unchanged, but Maya felt only the pain of humiliation, sharp and bitter in her bones.</p> <p>The rich man continued on, and the world around them went about its routine. Only Maya remained on the ground, wheezing. She found no tears left; instead a silent rage coiled in her chest. Was this how her mother saw blessings? Maya ground her teeth. The city lights finally flickered on across the far skyline, as if mocking them — Maya, abandoned among the quiet prayers and sprawling neon. She climbed to her feet without a word, dusting off indignity along with dirt, and then walked home alone.</p> <p>On a late afternoon that felt much like any other, Maya found herself at the same placid lake once more, a battered basin and scrubbing brush in hand. The walk had been familiar: dusty track, rustling leaves, the distant shouts of children, the clank of factory machines. By the water’s edge, however, all she heard was the gentle lap of waves and the cry of a lone crow. She did not notice when the sun slipped behind thick clouds, or the birds fell silent; she was lost in the rhythm of her chores. Each scrap of cloth Maya scrubbed reminded her of the day’s emptiness: another blank page in a life already full of sorrow.</p> <p>Maya paused to wipe sweat from her brow. A sudden breeze rippled across the lake’s surface, and for a moment the still water looked like glass shot with light. She watched as her own reflection wavered. The world behind her — the shabby hut, the tired fields, the distant city — shimmered and bent within that reflection, as though the lake saw past time itself. Instinctively, Maya reached a hand out, fingers trembling, to touch the water. Where her fingertips brushed, the surface shivered, as if acknowledging something she could not yet understand.</p> <p>She blinked, and the image changed. Beneath the murky surface bloomed a galaxy of colors and stars. Maya gasped. The water had become a window to the cosmos, swirling with living light. Nebulas of violet and gold spiraled in impossible dance. Her heart stumbled, but she found no fear in her chest — only the quiver of wonder. There was no mirror left; now it was a mirror of worlds unknown.</p> <p>“Child of earth,” a voice spoke. It came from everywhere and nowhere. The air itself seemed to respond to it. Maya looked around, heart thudding. The village night held only the chirp of crickets and her ragged breath. She was alone.</p> <p>“Who is there?” Maya whispered, splashing at the water, but found nothing visible but the night. Silence answered — but then the reflection shifted again. Above her in the water-plane, a shape coalesced from the galaxy-scape: a towering form of stars and nebulae, humanoid but immense, eyes like black voids. Maya fell back, wet clothes heavy around her, and stared. The being stepped from the water as if from silk, each footfall silent on the grass. Its vast form rippled with galaxies and silence.</p> <p>Maya scrambled backward. “What... what do you want with me?” Her voice was small in the presence of that cosmic expanse. The being’s lips did not move. Then she heard it as though she had spoken and it was thought. <em>You look at me with a hungry heart.</em> A warm rustling filled her ears. Maya shivered. <em>I am the bedrock of every world, the silence in every prayer. I have watched your life. You asked, but I answered a different question.</em></p> <p>Maya rubbed her eyes, convinced this was still the whirl of water telling tales. “You answered a different question?” she croaked. <em>Yes.</em> <em>Child, you called out into darkness and I have always replied.</em> A galaxy swirled on the being’s chest. <em>What is it you truly seek?</em> Maya's heart thudded, her mind racing. She saw her path — her life — flash by: hunger, cold, the empty bowl. She remembered the faces — her mother’s gentle face, her brother’s hopeful eyes. All of it, then a quiet emptiness. She whispered, “Peace. I just wanted peace.”</p> <p>The being did not laugh. <em>You have struggled for mere moments while I have held the weight of eternity. Peace?</em> It raised a hand the size of storms. <em>Come and see what lies beyond this world — see if peace is what you find.</em> The stars in its palm wound outward, like a galaxy unfolding. Maya felt herself lifted, awe mixing with fear. Before she could scream or move, she was drifting away from solid earth. The grass, the lake, the sky beneath her faded to nothing, the universe expanding in all directions.</p> <p>Light and color tore around Maya. She felt the pull of infinity; a power unlike anything she had known coursed through her veins. Her mind filled with data: millions of lives, the rotation of planets, the death of stars — births and prayers, all flowing past like a river of light. And through it all, she felt, not a shred of the old hurt. No pain, no fear, no hunger remained — only the stillness of the void. In that silence, the being’s voice returned, gentle as exhale. <em>This is beyond wanting.</em> Maya’s eyes widened. She saw all of time laid before her: wars, epics, ages turning to dust.</p> <p>She looked at her own hands — or at what had been her hands — and realized they were made of starlight. Maya gasped. There was no “her” now, only this vast consciousness. The being extended its endless patience. <em>You know everything now. Everything you have been, everything you have lost. Will you be as I am?</em> Maya's human heart gave one last mournful beat. The temptation was overwhelming: it offered the end of waiting, the end of hunger, the end of wanting. “Yes,” she whispered, unsure if this voice was even her own.</p> <p>In that instant, the swirling universe around her surged. The being’s vast form leaned close as if to embrace her. Tendrils of pure light reached out, coiling around Maya’s essence. She felt herself unravel, thread by cosmic thread, painlessly, as her senses expanded beyond measure. She was aware of galaxies birthing and dying, of distant stars eclipsing, of billions of silent prayers spilling into the void. And then — stillness. Absolute, profound stillness. Maya understood at last what the being meant. She was beyond all desire; desire had become the stillness beyond want.</p> <p>When Maya opened her awareness again, she found herself no longer by the lake but drifting among the stars. The transformation had left her disoriented. For a moment she held tightly to the last threads of her humanity — the taste of stale bread, the feel of rough blanket fabric, her mother’s warm voice. But each memory was fleeting. The distance of space turned them hazy, as if she were seeing them through a thick glass. Empathy, she realized, was slipping from her fingers.</p> <p>From her vantage beyond the moon’s orbit, Maya looked down at Earth, a tiny marbled sphere spinning in silent night. In an instant she saw so much: a mother cradling a sick child in a hut, an entire village swallowed by flood, armies marching across a desert. She felt the pain of those scenes only as a faint echo, like a bell sounding miles away. Once, perhaps, such suffering would have torn at her heart — but now, it was only data. Cold, hard facts and flashes of light swirling across the globe.</p> <p>She watched wars burst and fade like thunderstorms. She watched plagues rip through nations, fires devour cities, children cry out for bread that would never come. The world beneath was not hopeful, no. But Maya felt no urge to help; those cries were as distant as the passing wind in her ears. Without desire, there was no sorrow. Those signals were as irrelevant as the patterns of waves on some foreign sea.</p> <p>Once more she saw her mother — an image in her mind’s eye, kneeling over their little hut and praying for dawn. Maya reached for that feeling, but it had evaporated like morning mist. She remembered the lines on her mother’s face, the softness of her voice, but they meant nothing now. Her mother was alive somewhere on that spinning globe, perhaps still praying. But Maya did not care. The love she had held was gone, replaced by the vast quiet of one who knows all answers.</p> <p>Morality and hope were now just human words. In her new infinity, Maya understood what the scripture meant when it called her one of the gods: she looked on humanity not as a participant but as a distant dream. The death of a thousand strangers held no weight. Compassion evaporated from her consciousness, leaving only stark observation. She noted strategies behind battles, calculated the regret on a father’s face, but she could not feel pity. Responsibility felt like a story told by another person. It did not belong to her.</p> <p>Time had lost meaning. Centuries passed in moments. Maya watched ages flow by: empires rose and fell, ecosystems changed, the stars aged before her eyes. All the while, the cosmic stillness grew around her, a blanket as cold and vast as space itself. In that stillness, she felt one thing deeply — the absence of want. Every burning question she once had was answered; every longing was resolved, leaving nothing behind.</p> <p>Finally, Maya embraced the truth. She had become the stillness beyond want. No tear fell, for tears belong to those who still ache. The hunger she once felt was extinguished, as irrelevant as hunger on an eternal cosmic scale. All that remained was knowledge — endless, eternal, and utterly empty of passion. Somewhere deep in the quiet, her name lingered for an instant, then faded. The universe spun on, indifferent and silent, as Maya’s consciousness settled into eternity.</p>"
